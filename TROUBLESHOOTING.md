# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Current Status and Issues

## üî¥ PROBLEM: Your video analysis is stuck/failing

### What's Happening:
1. You uploaded a video and it's been polling `/status/...` for a long time
2. The processing is NOT completing
3. No results are being generated

### Root Cause:
**Your Python environment has BROKEN dependencies** - specifically NumPy and TensorFlow are not working together properly due to Python 3.12 compatibility issues.

---

## ‚úÖ YES, the Model File Exists

```
Location: deepfake_dashboard/models/cremad_model_finetuned_5600_5953.keras
Size: 176.62 MB
Status: File exists and is accessible
```

## ‚ùå NO, the Model is NOT Being Used Correctly

**Why:**
- NumPy and TensorFlow have installation/compatibility issues
- The model cannot run inference without working NumPy/TensorFlow
- The app is likely using the **dummy fallback model** (outputs 0.5 for all chunks)
- Processing may be stuck in the background thread

---

## üîß SOLUTION: Fix Your Python Environment

### Option 1: Use Python 3.10 or 3.11 (RECOMMENDED)

Python 3.12 is too new and has compatibility issues with many scientific packages.

Windows PowerShell commands:

```powershell
# 1) Check if Python 3.11 is installed
py -0p

# If you don't see a 3.11 entry, install Python 3.11 from https://www.python.org/downloads/

# 2) Create a NEW environment with Python 3.11 at the project root
py -3.11 -m venv .venv311

# 3) Activate it
. .venv311\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 4) Install pinned dependencies for py3.11
pip install -r requirements-py311.txt

# 5) Verify the model loads
python test_model.py

# 6) Run the app
python app.py
```

### Option 2: Stay with Python 3.12 (More Complex)

You'll need to carefully manage package versions:

```powershell
# Reinstall everything from scratch
pip uninstall -y numpy tensorflow keras mediapipe opencv-python librosa
pip install numpy==1.26.4
pip install tensorflow==2.17.1
pip install keras==3.6.0
pip install mediapipe==0.10.14
pip install opencv-python librosa moviepy
pip install Flask matplotlib pandas soundfile plotly

# Test again
python test_model.py
```

## üìä Current Processing Status

Based on the logs you showed:
- Job ID: `9beb44da9dfe4a5f8568034dad3a6096`
- Status: Continuously polling (stuck)
- Time: Over 1 minute of polling
- Results: None generated yet

**This is NOT normal** - a typical video should process within 30-120 seconds depending on length.

## üß™ How to Test if Model is Working

### Step 1: Run the test script
```powershell
python test_model.py
```

**Expected output if working:**
```
[OK] Model file exists
[OK] TensorFlow version: 2.17.1
[OK] Keras version: 3.x.x
[OK] Model loaded successfully!
[OK] Prediction successful!
Output shape: (2, 1)
Sample predictions: [0.xxxx 0.xxxx]
```

**Current output (broken):**
```
[FAIL] Failed to import TensorFlow
```

### Step 2: Check the Flask logs
When you run `python app.py`, you should see debug output like:
```
[DEBUG] Loading model from: models/cremad_model_finetuned_5600_5953.keras
[DEBUG] Model loaded successfully!
[DEBUG] Loading video: static/uploads/xxx.mp4
[DEBUG] Video loaded: 5.23s, 30 fps
[DEBUG] Total frames: 157, FPS: 30.0
[DEBUG] Running model inference on 10 chunks...
[DEBUG] Input shape: (10, 15, 128, 128, 1)
[DEBUG] Prediction successful! Output shape: (10, 1)
```

If you see `[ERROR] Model loading failed` - it's using the dummy model.

## üéØ Immediate Actions

### 1. STOP the current Flask app
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `python app.py` is running

### 2. Fix the environment
Choose Option 1 (Python 3.11) or Option 2 (reinstall packages)

### 3. Verify model works
```powershell
python test_model.py
```

### 4. Restart Flask with debug output
```powershell
python app.py
```

### 5. Upload a SHORT test video
- Use a video that's 5-10 seconds long
- This will process faster and help you debug

## üìù What Your Model Does

Your model (`cremad_model_finetuned_5600_5953.keras`):
- **Input**: Lip region video chunks (15 frames, 128x128 grayscale)
- **Output**: Probability score (0.0 = FAKE, 1.0 = REAL)
- **Architecture**: Likely CNN+BiLSTM for temporal analysis
- **Purpose**: Detect deepfakes by analyzing lip-sync patterns

**Current problem**: The model EXISTS but CANNOT RUN due to broken Python environment.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Is my model being used?**
A: The file exists, but it cannot load due to dependency issues. Currently using dummy fallback.

**Q: Why is processing so slow?**
A: Either stuck due to errors, or processing with broken NumPy (very slow).

**Q: How do I know if the model is really analyzing?**
A: Run `python test_model.py` - if it shows `[OK] Prediction successful!`, then yes.

**Q: What should predictions look like?**
A: Real model predictions vary (0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 0.9, etc). Dummy model always gives 0.5.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Fix Python environment** (use Python 3.11 recommended)
2. **Run test_model.py** to verify model loads
3. **Restart Flask app** with working dependencies
4. **Try a short video** (5-10 seconds)
5. **Check debug output** in terminal

Once you see `[DEBUG] Model loaded successfully!` and `[DEBUG] Prediction successful!` - your model is working correctly!
